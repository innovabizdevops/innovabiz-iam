# HIPAA Compliance Validator for IAM

**Author:** Eduardo Jeremias  
**Date:** 05/06/2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Overview

This module implements HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance validations for the INNOVABIZ IAM system. HIPAA is a set of United States regulations that defines standards for the protection of personal health information (PHI).

The validator checks if IAM configurations comply with HIPAA security and privacy requirements, especially when the Healthcare module is active.

## Integration with Healthcare Module

The HIPAA validator is designed to work in conjunction with the INNOVABIZ Healthcare module, performing additional health data-specific checks when this module is active. For tenants that do not use the Healthcare module, the requirements are marked as "not applicable".

## Implemented Requirements

The validator implements the following HIPAA requirements related to IAM:

### Authentication and Identification

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-AUTH-001 | Implement procedures to verify that a person seeking access to PHI is who they claim to be | High |
| HIPAA-IAM-AUTH-002 | Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity | Medium |

### Access Control

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-ACC-001 | Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain PHI to allow access only to authorized persons or software programs | High |
| HIPAA-IAM-ACC-002 | Establish role-based access control and implement policies for appropriate access levels for workforce members | High |

### Audit

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-AUD-001 | Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain PHI | High |
| HIPAA-IAM-AUD-002 | Implement procedures to regularly review records of information system activity, such as audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports | Medium |

### Integrity

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-INT-001 | Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that PHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner | High |

### Emergency Management

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-EMG-001 | Establish procedures for obtaining necessary PHI during an emergency, including emergency access procedure | Medium |

### Reporting and Monitoring

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| HIPAA-IAM-MON-001 | Implement procedures to monitor logs and detect security-relevant events that could result in unauthorized access of PHI | Medium |

## Recommended Configuration

Example configuration to enable HIPAA validation for a tenant using the Healthcare module:

```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "mfa_enabled": true,
    "identity_verification": {
      "strong_id_check": true,
      "identity_proofing": true
    }
  },
  "sessions": {
    "inactivity_timeout_minutes": 30
  },
  "modules": {
    "healthcare": {
      "enabled": true,
      "phi_session_timeout_minutes": 15,
      "mfa_required_for_phi": true,
      "phi_access_controls": {
        "minimum_necessary_principle": true,
        "data_segmentation": true,
        "contextual_access": true
      },
      "roles": {
        "role_separation": true,
        "physician": ["view_patient", "edit_record", "prescribe"],
        "nurse": ["view_patient", "update_vitals"],
        "admin": ["manage_accounts", "view_billing"],
        "researcher": ["view_anonymized_data"]
      },
      "audit": {
        "phi_access_logging": true,
        "log_review_interval_hours": 24
      },
      "emergency_access": true
    }
  },
  "access_control": {
    "rbac": {
      "enabled": true,
      "default_deny": true
    }
  },
  "audit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "log_retention_days": 365,
    "log_review_enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Integration with Compliance Reports

The HIPAA validator integrates with the compliance report generation system, providing:

1. Overall HIPAA compliance score
2. List of compliant, partially compliant, and non-compliant requirements
3. Recommendations to remediate non-compliance issues
4. Evidence of current configurations relevant to HIPAA

## Regional Applicability

The HIPAA validator is only applicable to the United States region (RegionCode.US). For other regions, the requirements are automatically marked as "not applicable".

## Limitations

- The current validator focuses on IAM configuration and does not validate the complete technical implementation
- Some procedural aspects of HIPAA cannot be validated by configuration alone
- The current implementation does not cover 100% of HIPAA requirements related to security and IAM
