def validate_unique_user_identification(iam_config):
    """
    Verifies if each system user has a unique identifier.
    HIPAA Security Rule 164.312(a)(1) requires user identification and tracking.
    """
    # Implemented verification
    has_unique_ids = iam_config.get("user_policies", {}).get("unique_identifiers", False)
    has_tracking = iam_config.get("audit", {}).get("user_tracking_enabled", False)
    
    if not has_unique_ids:
        return ValidationResult(
            status="FAILED",
            message="Unique user identifiers are not configured",
            remediation="Configure unique identifiers for each user in the IAM system"
        )
    
    if not has_tracking:
        return ValidationResult(
            status="WARNING",
            message="User activity tracking is not enabled",
            remediation="Enable user activity tracking in the audit settings"
        )
    
    return ValidationResult(
        status="PASSED",
        message="Unique user identification correctly implemented"

    for health data processing as per Article 9(2)(a) of GDPR.
    """
    # Implemented verification
    consent_mechanism = iam_config.get("consent_management", {})
    has_explicit_consent = consent_mechanism.get("explicit_consent_for_health_data", False)
    consent_versioning = consent_mechanism.get("consent_versioning_enabled", False)
    consent_withdrawal = consent_mechanism.get("consent_withdrawal_process", False)

        return ValidationResult(
            status="FAILED",
            message="Explicit consent mechanism for health data not implemented",
            remediation="Implement an explicit consent mechanism for health data"
        )
    
    if not consent_versioning:
        return ValidationResult(
            status="WARNING",
            message="Consent versioning is not enabled",
            remediation="Implement consent versioning to track changes"
        )
    
    if not consent_withdrawal:
        return ValidationResult(
            status="WARNING",
            message="Consent withdrawal process is not configured",
            remediation="Implement a clear process for consent withdrawal"
        )
    
    return ValidationResult(
        status="PASSED",
        message="Explicit consent mechanism correctly implemented"

    is processed only for specific purposes, as per Article 11 of LGPD.
    """
    # Implemented verification
    purpose_limitation = iam_config.get("data_processing", {}).get("purpose_limitation", {})
    has_health_purpose = purpose_limitation.get("health_data_specific_purpose", False)

    if not has_purpose_registry:
        return ValidationResult(
            status="WARNING",
            message="Processing purposes registry is not enabled",
            remediation="Implement a registry of purposes for data processing"
        )
    
    return ValidationResult(
        status="PASSED",
        message="Purpose limitation for health data correctly implemented"

   - Enhance detail of existing validations
   - Integrate with external control catalogs

2. **Artificial Intelligence**
   - Implement anomaly detection in access patterns
   - Develop adaptive remediation recommendations
   - Automate impact analysis of regulatory changes

3. **Advanced Interoperability**
   - Integrate with external governance, risk, and compliance systems
   - Implement compliance data exchange with partners
   - Develop public API for compliance status queries
