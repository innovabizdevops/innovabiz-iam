# IAM Compliance Framework

## Introduction

This document defines the Compliance Framework for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) module of the INNOVABIZ platform. The framework establishes a structured approach to ensure that the IAM system meets global and sector-specific regulatory requirements, including data protection, healthcare, financial, and IT governance regulations.

## Framework Overview

The IAM Compliance Framework is structured around four main pillars:

1. **Governance**: Policies, procedures, and organizational structures
2. **Implementation**: Technical and operational controls
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous compliance verification
4. **Improvement**: Enhancement process based on assessments

## Regulatory Control Matrix

The IAM system implements a regulatory control matrix that maps specific requirements from each regulation to technical and procedural controls:

### Example: GDPR

| Art. 32: Processing Security | Encryption, Access controls, Security testing | Security configurations, Test reports |
| Art. 35: DPIA | Impact assessments for high-risk processing | Documented DPIAs |

### Example: HIPAA

| Requirement | IAM Controls | Compliance Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 164.312(a): Access Control | MFA Authentication, RBAC/ABAC Authorization, Access Logs | Security configurations, Audit logs |
| 164.312(b): Audit | Immutable logs, Audit trails, Alerts | Log configurations, Audit reports |
| 164.312(c): Integrity | Digital signatures, Integrity verification | Verification configurations, Integrity logs |
| 164.312(e): Transmission Security | TLS, End-to-end encryption | TLS configurations, Certificates |
