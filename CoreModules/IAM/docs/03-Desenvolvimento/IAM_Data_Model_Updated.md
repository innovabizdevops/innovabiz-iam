# IAM Module Data Model - INNOVABIZ

## Overview

This document describes the data model for the IAM (Identity and Access Management) module of the INNOVABIZ platform, with emphasis on supporting the 70 authentication methods as defined in the implementation plan. The model was designed to meet the following requirements:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple clients (tenants) in a single instance
- **Multi-regional**: Specific adaptations for target regions (EU/Portugal, Brazil, Angola, USA)
- **Regulatory compliance**: Adherence to GDPR, LGPD, PNDSB, and US regulations
- **Scalability**: Optimized structure for high volume of authentications
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new authentication methods
- **Security**: Compliance with security best practices (NIST, ISO 27001)

## Database Structure

The IAM module has its own database that integrates with the main INNOVABIZ platform database. All tables are organized under the `iam` schema for isolation and organization.

### Relationships

The data model follows a relational structure with the following connections:

1. A **tenant** can have many **users**
2. A **user** can have multiple associated **authentication methods**
3. A **user** can have many active **sessions**
4. A **tenant** can define multiple **authentication flows**
5. A **user** has one **risk profile**
6. A **tenant** can have multiple **applications**
7. An **authentication method** can be associated with multiple **tenants**

## Secure Storage

- **Passwords**: Stored using Argon2id (recommended algorithm for 2025+)
- **Sensitive Data**: Individually encrypted
- **Tokens**: Using secure signature mechanisms (with key rotation)
- **Biometric Data**: Stored as secure templates, never in raw format
- **Personal Data**: Respecting data minimization principles

## Security Considerations

- Complete protection against information leakage through SQL Injection
- Prevention of timing attacks in critical operations such as credential verification
- Real-time monitoring of suspicious authentication attempts
- Complete auditing of all authentication operations
- Optimized indexes for reducing response time without compromising security

## Extensibility

The model was designed to facilitate the addition of new authentication methods through:

1. Registration of the new method in the `iam.authentication_methods` table
2. Enabling the method for specific tenants
3. Configuration of regional adaptations
4. Integration with existing authentication flows

## Integration with the INNOVABIZ Platform

The IAM module integrates with other INNOVABIZ platform modules through:

1. Secure internal APIs
2. Events published on the event bus
3. Centralized authentication and authorization via KrakenD API Gateway
4. Support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for inter-module communication
