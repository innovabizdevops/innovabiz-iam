# IAM Operational Guide

## Introduction

This operational guide provides detailed information for administration, monitoring, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) module of the INNOVABIZ platform. It is intended for system administrators, operations teams, and technical support responsible for the continuous operation of the IAM system.

## Operational Overview

The IAM module requires well-defined operational processes to ensure continuous availability, security, and performance. This guide defines recommended operational practices, routine maintenance procedures, and incident response strategies.

| **System Operator** | Monitoring, routine maintenance, updates, and backups |
| **Security Analyst** | Log analysis, incident investigation, security checks |
| **Database Administrator** | Database optimization, maintenance, and backup |
| **Level 1 Support** | Basic user problem resolution, escalation of complex issues |
| **Level 2 Support** | Technical problem resolution, root cause investigation |
| **Level 3 Support** | Complex problem resolution, contact with development team |
