# IAM Maintenance Procedures

## Introduction

This document describes the maintenance procedures for the IAM (Identity and Access Management) module of the INNOVABIZ platform. Proper maintenance of identity and access components is essential to ensure the security, availability, performance, and ongoing compliance of the system.

The procedures described here were designed for multi-tenant, multi-region environments and adapted to the specific regulatory requirements of each implementation region (EU/Portugal, Brazil, Africa/Angola, USA).

## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives

- Ensure continuous availability of IAM services
- Maintain optimal performance of IAM components
- Ensure the integrity and security of identity data
- Facilitate controlled evolution of the IAM architecture
- Ensure ongoing regulatory compliance

### Scope

This document covers the maintenance of the following IAM components:

- Authentication and authorization services
- Identity directories and policy stores
- APIs and management interfaces
- Integrations with external providers
- Identity federation components
- IAM-specific infrastructure

## Maintenance Planning

### Maintenance Windows

|------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Routine Maintenance** | Weekly | 2-4 hours | Minimal/None | 72 hours |
| **Planned Maintenance** | Monthly | 4-8 hours | Moderate | 2 weeks |
| **Major Maintenance** | Quarterly | 8-12 hours | Significant | 1 month |
| **Emergency Updates** | As needed | Variable | Potentially high | Immediate |

### Regional Planning

Maintenance windows are staggered by region to minimize global impact:

| Region | Primary Window | Secondary Window | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| EU/Portugal | Sunday, 01:00-05:00 UTC | Wednesday, 02:00-04:00 UTC | GDPR regulations, low utilization |
| Brazil | Sunday, 03:00-07:00 BRT | Tuesday, 23:00-01:00 BRT | LGPD compliance, local time zone |
| Africa/Angola | Saturday, 23:00-03:00 WAT | Thursday, 02:00-04:00 WAT | Local infrastructure, connectivity considerations |
| USA | Sunday, 02:00-06:00 EST | Saturday, 22:00-00:00 EST | High availability, sector-specific regulations |
