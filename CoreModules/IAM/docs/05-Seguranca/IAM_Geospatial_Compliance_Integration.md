# IAM Geospatial Compliance Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the integration between the IAM module and the Geospatial Regulatory Visualization System of the INNOVABIZ platform. This integration enhances the platform's capability to manage identity and access controls based on geographical regulatory contexts, supporting the multi-regional implementation strategy across EU/Portugal, Brazil, Africa/Angola, and the United States.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this integration is to:

1. Enable geospatially-aware access control decisions based on regulatory contexts
2. Provide visualization and management of identity and access regulations by geographic region
3. Support compliance with region-specific identity and privacy regulations
4. Facilitate cross-regional operations while maintaining regulatory compliance
5. Enhance auditability and reporting of access patterns across geographic boundaries

This document is intended for:
- Security architects and engineers
- IAM administrators and operators
- Compliance officers and auditors
- Regulatory affairs specialists

## Architectural Overview

### System Integration

The IAM module integrates with the Geospatial Regulatory Visualization System through a series of well-defined interfaces:

## Geospatial Data Model

### Core Entities

The integration is built on the following data model extensions to the IAM system:

#### Regulatory Jurisdiction

```typescript
interface RegulatoryJurisdiction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  code: string;
  level: 'GLOBAL' | 'REGIONAL' | 'NATIONAL' | 'STATE' | 'LOCAL';
  parentJurisdictionId?: string;
  geographicBoundaries: GeoJSON.Polygon;
  effectiveDate: Date;
  supersededDate?: Date;
  regulatoryAuthorities: RegulatorInfo[];
}
```

#### Identity Regulation

```typescript
interface IdentityRegulation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  jurisdictionId: string;
  category: 'PRIVACY' | 'AUTHENTICATION' | 'AUTHORIZATION' | 'AUDIT' | 'REPORTING';
  subCategory: string;
  description: string;
  effectiveDate: Date;
  complianceDeadline: Date;
  supersededDate?: Date;
  implementingControls: IAMControlReference[];
  riskLevel: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';

  };
  crossBorderDataControls?: {
    allowDataTransfer: boolean;
    requiredProtections: string[];
    transferDocumentationRequired: boolean;
    dataResidencyRequirements: string[];
  };
}
```

   - Support for multiple identity assurance frameworks
   - Mapping between different regional standards

2. **Compliance Conflicts**
   - Resolution of contradictory regulatory requirements
   - Prioritization framework for conflicting rules
   - Exception handling for unresolvable conflicts

3. **Extraterritorial Application**
   - Management of regulations with extraterritorial scope
   - Implementation of controls for overlapping jurisdictions
   - Documentation of compliance approach for complex scenarios

## Implementation and Testing
