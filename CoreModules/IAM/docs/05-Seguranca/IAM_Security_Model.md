# IAM Security Model

## Introduction

This document defines the security model for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) module of the INNOVABIZ platform. The model presents a comprehensive approach to protecting all aspects of the IAM system, including data, communications, processes, and infrastructure, while meeting global and sector-specific regulatory requirements.

## Security Principles

The IAM security model is founded on the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Security controls at multiple layers
2. **Least Privilege**: Granting only the necessary rights for each function
3. **Segmentation**: Isolation of critical components and sensitive data
4. **Fail Secure**: Safe behavior in case of errors or failures
5. **Security by Design**: Integration of security controls from conception
6. **Transparency**: Complete visibility of security operations
7. **Resilience**: Ability to withstand and recover from threats
8. **Continuous Evolution**: Adaptation to emerging threats and new requirements

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

The IAM implements a data classification model with the following levels:

| Level | Classification | Examples | Controls |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Public | Public documentation, non-sensitive metadata | Basic integrity protection |
| 2 | Internal | Configurations, usage statistics, non-sensitive logs | Controlled access, auditing |
| 3 | Confidential | User details, authentication history | Encryption, restricted access |
| 4 | Highly Confidential | Credentials, cryptographic keys, biometric data | Strong encryption, secure storage, highly restricted access |

### Data Encryption

#### At Rest

- **Level 3-4 Data**: AES-256-GCM with managed keys
- **Secrets**: Dedicated cryptographic vault with HSM
- **Credentials**: Password hash functions with Argon2id (work factor 16+)
- **Biometric Templates**: Irreversible transformations with user-specific keys

#### In Transit

- **TLS 1.3** for all external communications
- **Mutual TLS** for microservice-to-microservice communications
- **Certificates** managed with automatic rotation
- **Cipher suites** limited to the most secure implementations

#### Key Management

The system implements a Hierarchy of Keys (HoK) with:

1. **Master Key**: Stored in HSM, used only to encrypt the data encryption keys
2. **Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)**: Encrypted by the Master Key, used to encrypt the DEKs
3. **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**: Used to encrypt the actual data
4. **Automatic Rotation**: Schedule based on the sensitivity of data and keys

## Identity Protection

### Authentication

#### Authentication Factors

The model supports various authentication factors, including:

1. **Knowledge**: Passwords, PINs, security question answers
2. **Possession**: TOTP, physical devices (YubiKey, SmartCards), certificates
3. **Inherence**: Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition)
4. **Context**: Location, behavioral patterns, known devices
5. **AR/VR**: Spatial gestures, gaze patterns, 3D spatial passwords

#### Credential Protection

- **Password Policies**: Complexity based on entropy (minimum 70 bits)
- **Storage**: Hash with Argon2id, unique salt per user, global pepper
- **Attempt Limitation**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Leaked Credential Detection**: Verification against known compromised credential databases

#### Adaptive Authentication

The system implements adaptive authentication with:

- **Risk Scoring**: Based on multiple behavioral and contextual factors
- **Progressive Challenges**: Increasing verification intensity based on risk
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection in authentication patterns
- **Contextualization**: Analysis of device, network, location, time, and behavior

### Sessions

- **Temporal Limitation**: Expiration based on inactivity and maximum duration
- **Device Binding**: Session association to device fingerprint
- **Real-Time Revocation**: Capability to terminate sessions immediately
- **Regeneration**: Periodic rotation of session identifiers

## Authorization

### Hybrid RBAC/ABAC Model

The system implements an access control model that combines:

1. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
   - Roles defined by organizational function and responsibilities
   - Role hierarchy with permission inheritance
   - Dynamic segregation of duties

2. **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**:
   - Policies based on user, resource, action, and context attributes
   - Conditional expressions for dynamic authorization
   - Support for complex rules based on multiple attributes

### Authorization Policies

- **Centralized Policies**: Definition and management in a central repository
- **Real-Time Evaluation**: Authorization decisions at runtime
- **Tenant-Specific Policies**: Customization by organization
- **Versioning**: Complete history of policy changes
- **Simulation**: Capability to test the impact of policy changes

## Platform Protection

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse
- **Input Validation**: Rigorous verification of all input data
- **Injection Protection**: Defenses against SQL, NoSQL, LDAP injection
- **XSS/CSRF Prevention**: Security headers and anti-CSRF tokens

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Isolation at the database level
- **Tenant Context**: Context enforcement at all layers
- **Isolated Namespaces**: Logical separation of shared resources
- **Cryptographic Key Separation**: Distinct keys per tenant

### Infrastructure Hardening
